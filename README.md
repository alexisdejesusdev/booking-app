8. Select the booking-app project, click Add > and then click Finish.

9. IMPORTANT: Before starting up the app, you MUST download and copy the database files in any local file system folder. It's recommended to put them both inside the temp folder of the tomcat installation folder: E.g. "C:\\apache-tomcat-8.0.32\\temp", please note that the file separators differ depending on the operating system.

[tripRecords.json](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B0VKN70UtF7nUnFnOUNFM2VHVTg)

10. IMPORTANT: After copying both files, you MUST modify the file persistence.properties and update the property "persistence.path" to the path value where the files where put. 

E.g. "persistence.path = C:\\apache-tomcat-8.0.32\\temp"

11. The project will appear on the servers view, click on the Tomcat v8.0 server name and click the Start Server button the server will start after that.

12. Open the Chrome browser and enter to the following URL into the address bar. [http://localhost:8080/booking-app/index.html](http://localhost:8080/booking-app/index.html)

## Unit tests

The test will automatically run while building the maven project, however you can find them in the folder: src/text/java. 

The provided tests are just a reference of the main validations that the service layer performs, they're meant to exemplify how the full test will be done.  


## Deployment

To build and deploy the whole project and test it outside eclipse the next steps should be followed:

1. From the command line or maven console, move to the folder where the pom.xml file is saved.

2. Run the command mvn clean install.

3. After the process is finished move to the target folder created as a result of the previous step and copy the file called booking-app.war.

4. Paste the copied file to the webapps folder of the tomcat installation directory.

5. Start the tomcat service as told in the [official documentation] (https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-8.0-doc/setup.html).

6. Open the Chrome browser and enter to the following URL into the address bar. [http://localhost:8080/booking-app/index.html](http://localhost:8080/booking-app/index.html)
